            	'content_full' 	=> '<p>Lately, we hear more and more about the slow economy, and how it has  affected business men and women from all sectors. While this may be true  for some individuals, others are expanding more rapidly than ever—and  with this jump in business comes a need for more space. In many cases,  business owners choose to expand their existing building, while others  may choose to build a new facility altogether. Regardless of their  manner of expansion, the likelihood of a mess following construction  work is high. To manage the situation, many busy business men and women  turn to post construction cleaning services. High quality post  construction cleaning services can not only clean the building in which  the work was done, but may also be able to prevent the need for  additional employees, limit distractions, and perform a number of other  day-to-day cleaning tasks. For optimal results, business owners should  be sure to hire a commercial building cleaning company that comes with  quality references and recommendations. While most business men and  women should be able to obtain recommendations from friends or  colleagues in the field, others may choose to search for organizations  through Internet referrals.</p><h2>Clean Building</h2><p>In the majority of cases, the main reason for hiring a commercial  building cleaning company is to manage the dust, debris, and left-over  construction materials of a building rejuvenation or creation. In most  cases, commercial building cleaning requires the use of specific tools  and techniques with which outsiders may not have a familiarity. In  addition, professional commercial cleaning companies will be aware of  local laws and ordinances surrounding the disposal of construction  materials. Following these rules and regulations is essential to the  prevention of expensive fines and bills after the completion of building  construction or remodeling.</p><h2>No Extra Employees</h2><p>As discussed above, many outsiders to the construction industry are  not aware of the “ins and outs” of cleaning a construction site. While  some business owners may be tempted to use an existing employee for the  task, slower rates of work and ignorance about cleaning techniques and  disposal laws can result in more trouble than it is worth. Similarly,  some employers may choose to hire an additional employee to manage the  construction site clean-up. While this employee may be experienced and  highly qualified for the task, he or she will usually also need a  substantial hourly salary, insurance, and other financial requirements.  In most cases, a professional commercial cleaning company is the most  effective and inexpensive manner of dealing with post-construction  clean-up. Despite the belief of many business owners, professional  commercial cleaning companies can be quite inexpensive, and often do a  fabulous job.</p><h2>Limited Distractions</h2><p>Most business men and women today are forced to perform a number of  daily duties and tasks—and in most cases, don’t have time to manage  another one. Luckily, hiring cleaning services, commercial-based, can be  an effective way to limit the distractions associated with managing a  post-construction clean-up. In most cases, cleaning services, commercial  or otherwise, will manage all tasks associated with a post-construction  clean-up, therefore leaving the business owner with the sole task of  running and growing the existing organization. To ensure optimal results  when it comes to hiring cleaning services, commercial business owners  and cleaning service managers should discuss identifiable tasks, their  expected completion time, and financial requirements. Some individuals  may wish to create a legal contract, which can prevent disputes from  escalating and will ensure they are handled in a professional, timely  manner.</p><h2>Additional Benefits to Hiring Post Construction Cleaning Services</h2><p>While a clean building, no extra employees, and limited  distractions are all obviously highly beneficial for business owners,  these are not the sole positive aspects of hiring a cleaning service.  Commercial business owners may also be able to arrange for cleaning  services to perform a number of other, more mundane cleaning tasks, such  as washing the carpet, cleaning the toilet, and even taking out the  garbage. When hiring a cleaning service, commercial business owners  should be sure to indicate their interest in the completion of these  tasks to ensure optimal results. While a cleaning service, commercial or  otherwise, will likely be willing to perform these tasks, they must be  made aware of the expectation ahead of time. Through proper  communication, business owners who are involved with building  construction or remodeling can ensure quality results from a post  construction cleaning company.</p><p>We offer rough, final and touch up construction cleaning services to newly built residential homes, condominiums, and commercial office and retail buildings.</p><p>We regularly perform Rough, Final and Touch Up Post Construction Cleaning to remove dirt, dust and debris from such areas as but not limited to:</p><ul><li>sliding glass doors, frames, and tracks.</li><li>bathroom tubs, shower, tile walls, vanity, sinks, toilets</li><li>kitchen cabinets, counter tops, appliances, sink, and floor.</li><li>all mirrors.</li><li>all doors and woodwork.</li><li>all floors</li><li>all balconies.</li><li>all carpets vacuumed</li></ul><p>In addition, our Construction Cleaning Supervisors perform regular inspections on the work performed at your facility and keep you informed of the progress.</p>'
